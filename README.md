# CP-HW3
The line 10 defines the color of the blades. The line 11 of the code defines the positions of the blades.
The line 21 controls the lawnmower. When the random number is larger than 0.999, the lawnmower will come.
The h is the original height of the grass and the point of the h variable is to define how tall the grass will increase in the next round.
-10 is because the ground's height is 10. height-10-random(h) is to make blades into different height.
What's the point of an object?
To put the data together.
What's an example of a range you might use for the map function?
Color changing happened in the canvas more than 255. Map function will take any range and map a value inside that range to a new value in any other range, so this function can define the area only in the color range instead of its canvas range.
What line of code would give me a random year in the last century?
random(1900,2000);
I tried to put the random function with the text function but it is not picking up a year.
