The line 10 defines the color of the blades. The line 11 of the code defines the positions of the blades.
The line 21 controls the lawnmower. When the random number is larger than 0.999, the lawnmower will come.
The h is the original height of the grass and the point of the h variable is to define how tall the grass will increase in the next round.
-10 is because the ground's height is 10. height-10-random(h) is to make blades into different height.
